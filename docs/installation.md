# Installation

molq requires Python 3.12 or later.

```sh
pip install molcrafts-molq
molq --version
```

The package includes the `molq` command and the compiled service. Source installs
require Go; the compiler version is listed in `go.mod`.

## On your machine

Local jobs require Bash on Linux or macOS. Remote jobs require system OpenSSH;
file transfers also require rsync. Windows supports the remote control plane.

The target must already have your program and its dependencies. Slurm, PBS, and
LSF commands run on the target account; molq does not install them.

## TypeScript

The SDK requires Node.js 22 or later for its Node transport.

```sh
npm install @molcrafts/molq
```

For HTTP connections, start a [shared service](configuration.md#shared-service).
Node can also start the installed `molq` executable through `StdioWire`.
See the [TypeScript guide](reference/typescript.md).

## From source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MolCrafts/molq.git
cd molq
uv sync --extra dev --extra docs
```

Build the manual locally:

```sh
uv run --extra docs zensical serve
```
