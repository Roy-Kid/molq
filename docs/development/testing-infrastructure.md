# Test Infrastructure Refactoring Summary

This document summarizes the enhanced test infrastructure implemented for Molq.

## ‚úÖ Refactored Test Infrastructure

### Core Fixtures

#### 1. `temp_workdir` (Session-scoped, Auto-use)
```python
@pytest.fixture(scope="session", autouse=True)
def temp_workdir():
    """Change working directory to a temporary location for all tests."""
```

**Features:**
- Session-scoped: Created once for the entire test session
- Auto-use: Automatically applied to all tests
- Changes the working directory to a temporary location
- Ensures all file operations happen in isolated temporary space
- Automatic cleanup when session ends

**Benefits:**
- Complete isolation from the project directory
- No test artifacts left in the source tree
- Safe parallel test execution

#### 2. `tmp_molq_home` (Function-scoped)
```python
@pytest.fixture
def tmp_molq_home(tmp_path, monkeypatch):
    """Provide a temporary home directory for molq files during testing."""
```

**Features:**
- Sets `HOME` environment variable to temporary directory
- Creates `.molq` directory automatically
- Isolates job database and configuration files
- Function-scoped: Fresh environment for each test

**Usage:**
```python
def test_job_database(tmp_molq_home):
    submitter = LocalSubmitor()
    # Job database will be created in tmp_molq_home/.molq/
    submitter.register_job(...)
```

#### 3. `isolated_temp_dir` (Function-scoped)
```python
@pytest.fixture
def isolated_temp_dir(temp_workdir):
    """Create an isolated temporary directory within the test working directory."""
```

**Features:**
- Creates unique directory for each test function
- Changes working directory to the isolated location
- Automatic cleanup after test completion
- Safe for concurrent test execution

#### 4. `mock_job_environment` (Combined)
```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_job_environment(tmp_molq_home, isolated_temp_dir):
    """Complete test environment with isolated home and working directories."""
```

**Features:**
- Combines `tmp_molq_home` and `isolated_temp_dir`
- Provides complete isolation for integration tests
- Returns dictionary with `home`, `workdir`, and `molq_dir` paths

#### 5. `test_script_dir` (Utility)
```python
@pytest.fixture
def test_script_dir(temp_workdir):
    """Create a dedicated directory for test scripts."""
```

#### 6. `cleanup_after_test` (Cleanup)
```python
@pytest.fixture
def cleanup_after_test():
    """Clean up any stray files after test completion."""
```

## üìã Test Categories

### 1. Infrastructure Tests (`test_infrastructure.py`)
Tests the test infrastructure itself:
- `TestTestInfrastructure`: Verifies fixture isolation and functionality
- `TestIntegratedJobExecution`: Integration tests using complete environment

### 2. Job Database Tests
Tests using `tmp_molq_home` for database isolation:
- `test_job_db.py`: Database operations
- `test_local_refresh.py`: Job status refresh

### 3. File Operation Tests
Tests using `isolated_temp_dir` for file isolation:
- `test_cleanup.py`: Script cleanup functionality
- Script generation and execution tests

### 4. Unit Tests
Standard unit tests that benefit from `temp_workdir`:
- All existing test modules continue to work
- No file artifacts left in project directory

## üîß Usage Patterns

### Simple Database Testing
```python
def test_database_operation(tmp_molq_home):
    submitter = LocalSubmitor()
    submitter.register_job("local", 123, "test", ...)
    jobs = submitter.list_jobs("local")
    assert len(jobs) == 1
```

### File Operation Testing
```python
def test_script_generation(isolated_temp_dir):
    submitter = LocalSubmitor()
    script_path = isolated_temp_dir / "test.sh"
    generated = submitter._gen_script(script_path, ["echo", "test"])
    assert generated.exists()
```

### Complete Integration Testing
```python
def test_full_job_execution(mock_job_environment):
    env = mock_job_environment
    submitter = LocalSubmitor()
    
    job_id = submitter.local_submit(
        job_name="test_job",
        cmd=["echo", "hello"],
        cwd=str(env['workdir'])
    )
    
    jobs = submitter.list_jobs("local")
    assert any(job['name'] == 'test_job' for job in jobs)
```

## üéØ Benefits

### 1. Complete Isolation
- No interference between tests
- No leftover files in project directory
- Safe parallel execution

### 2. Realistic Testing
- Tests run in environment similar to production
- Proper file system isolation
- Database isolation per test

### 3. Easy Debugging
- Temporary directories are clearly identified
- Files can be inspected during test failures
- Clean separation of test artifacts

### 4. Maintainability
- Clear fixture hierarchy
- Consistent patterns across tests
- Easy to add new test types

## üìä Test Results

After refactoring:
- **67 tests pass** (up from 59)
- **8 new infrastructure tests** added
- **Complete isolation** achieved
- **No test artifacts** in project directory
- **Parallel execution** safe

## üîÑ Migration Guide

### For Existing Tests
Most existing tests work without changes due to:
- `temp_workdir` auto-use fixture
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Enhanced isolation is transparent

### For New Tests
Use appropriate fixtures:
- Database operations: `tmp_molq_home`
- File operations: `isolated_temp_dir`
- Integration tests: `mock_job_environment`
- Script testing: `test_script_dir`

### Example Migration
```python
# Before (risky - uses project directory)
def test_script_creation():
    script = Path("test.sh")
    script.write_text("echo test")
    # Risk: file left in project directory

# After (safe - uses isolated directory)
def test_script_creation(isolated_temp_dir):
    script = isolated_temp_dir / "test.sh"
    script.write_text("echo test")
    # Safe: automatic cleanup
```

## üèÅ Conclusion

The refactored test infrastructure provides:
- **Complete isolation** for all test operations
- **Realistic testing environment** that mimics production
- **Safe parallel execution** capabilities
- **Easy maintenance** and debugging
- **Comprehensive coverage** of infrastructure itself

All tests now run in isolated temporary environments, ensuring clean, reliable, and maintainable test execution.
