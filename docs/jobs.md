# Submit jobs

Decorate a function with a registered destination:

```python
from molq import JobSpec, submit

local = submit("local")  # Bound in the quickstart.


@local
def hello(name):
    job = yield JobSpec.argv(["echo", f"hello {name}"])
    return job


job = hello("molq")
```

Every yielded request is a `JobSpec`. Use `JobSpec.argv(...)` for one command;
use the full constructor for resources, scheduling, and execution plans.
Each yield receives its `Job`. The generator's return is the decorated call's
result. See the [Python API](api.md) for synchronous and async examples.

Arguments remain literal. Request shell interpretation explicitly with
`ExecutionUnit.shell()` when you need pipes or redirection.

## Request an allocation

On a registered Slurm destination, request resources and queue settings separately
from the command:

```python
import json

from molq import Execution, ExecutionUnit, JobSpec, Resources, Scheduling, submit

spec = JobSpec(
    resources=Resources(
        nodes=1,
        tasks=1,
        cpus_per_task=4,
        memory_bytes="8000000000",
        time_limit_seconds=600,
    ),
    scheduling=Scheduling(name="simulation", account="your-project"),
    execution=Execution(
        cwd="/scratch/your-user/project",
        env={"OMP_NUM_THREADS": "4"},
        units=(ExecutionUnit.argv("main", ["python", "simulate.py"]),),
    ),
)
hpc = submit("hpc")
print(json.dumps(hpc.preview(spec), ensure_ascii=False))


@hpc
def simulate():
    job = yield spec
    return job
```

`memory_bytes` is a decimal string of bytes **per node**. The scheduler rounds
up to its native unit. CPU allocation does not set your application's thread
count; specify that in its arguments or environment.

`validate(spec)` checks the request. `preview(spec)` also returns the rendered
script. Neither proves that an account, partition, or resource is available.

## Execution plans

Run two branches together, then a final command. This example fits a single-node
Slurm allocation with two CPUs:

```python
import json

from molq import Parallel, Sequence, UnitRef

plan_spec = JobSpec(
    resources=Resources(nodes=1, tasks=2, cpus_per_task=1),
    execution=Execution(
        units=(
            ExecutionUnit.argv(
                "a", ["echo", "a"], placement={"tasks": 1, "cpus_per_task": 1}
            ),
            ExecutionUnit.argv(
                "b", ["echo", "b"], placement={"tasks": 1, "cpus_per_task": 1}
            ),
            ExecutionUnit.argv(
                "finish", ["echo", "done"], placement={"tasks": 1, "cpus_per_task": 1}
            ),
        ),
        plan=Sequence((Parallel((UnitRef("a"), UnitRef("b"))), UnitRef("finish"))),
    ),
)
print(json.dumps(hpc.preview(plan_spec), ensure_ascii=False))
```

Each unit appears once in the plan. A single unit needs no explicit plan.
`Sequence` stops on failure. `Parallel` waits for all started branches and
reports the first failure in plan order. Multiple units in a batch job require
an explicit task budget; parallel branches must fit that budget.

## MPI

Declare ranks and threads, and configure the cluster's launcher:

```python
from molq import Launch

mpi_spec = JobSpec(
    resources=Resources(nodes=2, tasks=8, cpus_per_task=2),
    execution=Execution(
        units=(
            ExecutionUnit.argv(
                "main",
                ["./solver"],
                launch=Launch(kind="mpi", ranks=8, threads=2),
            ),
        )
    ),
)
```

On Slurm with `launcher="srun"`, this renders an eight-rank native step.
The target must provide the executable and MPI environment.

## Dependencies

A dependency refers to another allocation in the same cluster:

```python
# previous is a submitted Job; next_execution is an Execution value.
dependent = JobSpec(
    execution=next_execution,
    scheduling=Scheduling(
        dependencies=({"ref": previous.ref, "condition": "after_success"},)
    ),
)
```

Conditions are `after`, `after_success`, `after_failure`, and `after_started`.
The scheduler must support the requested condition exactly; see [mappings](schedulers.md#scheduler-mappings).

Save `job.ref` after submission. If a mutation returns `OUTCOME_UNKNOWN`, inspect
native state before submitting again. A `request_key` deduplicates only within
the same service for a bounded interval; it does not survive a restart.
