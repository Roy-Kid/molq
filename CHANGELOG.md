# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added
- **Plugin host** (`molq.plugin`): `MolqPlugin` protocol, `PluginContext`,
  `PluginManager`, `available_plugins()`, `create_plugin()`, and
  `enabled_plugin_names()`. Official plugins ship in-tree; third-party
  plugins load from the `molq.plugins` setuptools entry-point group
  (official names win on conflict).
- **Official `nerve` plugin** (`molq.plugins.nerve`): rollup job status
  to a local Nerve ingest (`http://127.0.0.1:17890`). Display-only /
  fail-open; no scheduler or store writes.
- `Submitor(..., plugins=..., plugin_configs=...)` attaches observers
  for the session lifetime; `close()` detaches plugins.
- CLI: `molq plugins list`; `molq daemon` enables **nerve** when no
  `[plugins]` table is present in config.
- Config: `[plugins.<name>]` tables on the molq config file (canonical
  path via molcfg: `~/.molcrafts/molq/config/config.toml`).

### Changed
- CLI help reorganized into Jobs / History / Live / Setup groups.
- Docs site styling via **molcrafts-zensical-theme** (hero home, accent,
  light/dark). Concepts, CLI, and API docs cover plugins and nerve.

### Docs
- `docs/release-notes.md`, concepts, CLI, and API updated for the plugin
  host. README capability table includes `plugin` / `plugins`.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-11

### Breaking
- **`JobStore(db_path)` now requires an explicit path.** Constructing
  `JobStore()` with no argument used to silently default to
  `~/.molq/jobs.db` via `Path.home()`, which entangled every caller
  and every test run with the user's real on-disk database. The
  no-arg form now raises `TypeError`.
- **Canonical default location moved** from `~/.molq/jobs.db` to
  `~/.molcrafts/molq/config/jobs.db` (resolved via
  `molcfg.project_config_dir("molq")`, which honours `MOLCRAFTS_HOME`
  for redirection). The same move applies to `default_config_path()`
  for `~/.molq/config.toml` → `~/.molcrafts/molq/config/config.toml`.
  No automatic migration. To preserve existing data:

  ```bash
  mkdir -p ~/.molcrafts/molq/config
  mv ~/.molq/jobs.db     ~/.molcrafts/molq/config/jobs.db
  mv ~/.molq/config.toml ~/.molcrafts/molq/config/config.toml
  ```

### Added
- `molq.store.default_jobs_db_path()` — the only sanctioned source
  of a default DB location. Delegates to
  `molcfg.project_config_dir("molq")` which idempotently creates the
  directory on first call.
- `molq.ssh_config` — parsing of `~/.ssh/config` host profiles, with
  `tests/test_ssh_config.py` covering it.
- `molq.cluster` and `molq.workspace` — Cluster type extension and
  remote-workspace primitives.
- `examples/dardel_e2e.py` — end-to-end example exercising SSH
  transport against a Dardel-style remote host.

### Changed
- `Submitor(store=None)` still auto-bootstraps a `JobStore` (UX
  unchanged — user does not have to manually specify), but the path
  is now resolved explicitly through
  `JobStore(default_jobs_db_path())` rather than a hidden
  `Path.home()` lookup inside `JobStore.__init__`.
- CLI `--db` help text reflects the new molcfg-derived default.

### Removed
- `test_ssh_round_trip_against_real_host` — an env-gated
  (`MOLQ_SSH_TEST_HOST`) integration test that nobody ever set the
  variable for, so it never actually ran. Real SSH coverage belongs
  in a CI-provisioned integration suite, not in `test_transport.py`
  as default-skipped theatre.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-02

### Changed
- **Unified the local execution path.** `scheduler="local"` is now the
  no-batch-system backend (a `ShellScheduler` paired with whatever
  `Transport` you give the `Cluster`). All four scheduler kinds — `local`,
  `slurm`, `pbs`, `lsf` — now route every shell call through the
  Transport, so `Cluster(scheduler="local", host="...")` runs jobs on a
  remote workstation over SSH instead of silently ignoring `host=`.

### Removed
- `LocalScheduler` (the in-process `subprocess.Popen` + reaper
  implementation). Existing user code that constructs a `Cluster` with
  `scheduler="local"` is unaffected — the shell-based implementation is a
  drop-in replacement and writes the same `run.sh` / `_wrapper.sh` /
  `.exit_code` files. Code that imported `molq.scheduler.LocalScheduler`
  directly should switch to `ShellScheduler` (or `create_scheduler("local")`).
- The `"shell"` scheduler kind. Use `"local"` instead — the behavior is
  identical and now picks Transport from the `Cluster`.

### Fixed
- `ty check src/` now reports zero diagnostics (was 129 on 0.3.0). Most of
  the cleanup was annotating the `_conn` / `_store` invariants on
  `JobStore` and `Submitor`, switching `mollog` logger calls to f-strings
  (the `%s`-style positional API was rejected), making `_merge_one`
  generic, and threading explicit kwargs through
  `JobStore.compare_and_update_state` instead of an untyped `**kwargs`
  dict.

### Tooling
- `ty check src/`, `ruff check`, and `ruff format --check` are now
  enforced both in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (commit-time) and in CI via
  `pre-commit run --all-files`. Tests run as a pre-push hook locally and
  in CI's matrix job.
- `default_install_hook_types: [pre-commit, pre-push]` so a single
  `pre-commit install` registers both hooks.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- `--all` flag for the `watch` command to monitor all active jobs simultaneously.
- Release engineering files aligned with the `molcfg` repository structure.
- GitHub issue templates, pull request template, and `CODEOWNERS`.
- Rebuilt docs covering getting started, schedulers, monitoring, API, CLI, and release notes.

### Changed
- Rewrote `README.md` to match the current public API and CLI surface.
- Replaced legacy GitHub Actions workflows with a dedicated `CI` workflow and a tag-driven `Release` workflow.
- Tightened packaging metadata in `pyproject.toml` and added a typed-package marker.
- Replaced `tomllib` with `molcfg` for configuration loading.
- Refined artifact defaults and runtime behavior.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-06-24

### Added
- Initial beta release of `molq`.
- Local, SLURM, PBS, and LSF scheduler backends behind a unified `Submitor` API.
- Typed job submission models including `Memory`, `Duration`, `Script`, `JobResources`, `JobScheduling`, and `JobExecution`.
- SQLite-backed job store with reconciliation, monitoring, and CLI support.
